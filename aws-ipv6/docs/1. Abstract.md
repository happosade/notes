# Multi account networking

So, we need to get bits moving. In AWS (and in cloud in general) the idea is somewhat that you'll create VPCs for separate needs and they'll be your virtual datacenter. Then you'll do communication between those VPCs as needed. Separate needs could be per team, per product or something more enterprise'y.

In our case we have them by team plus some auxiliary VPCs, like connectivity back to on-premises and egress towards internet (when needed).

## Assumptions

The assumption made here is that you want to have more or less full connectivity across hybrid cloud setup. This usually means that you'll get way too small allocation of IPv4 addresses to make it work like they do it in most 

## IPAM

### Pricing cotcha!
Though AWS' pricing might make you think that IPAM is rather cheap as it only bills you per IP it manages, *be aware*, as when you enable it for regions, it discovers **all the ENIs and bills you per that**. There seems not to be a way to ignore existing ENIs and start the process all over in more... managed way. Also estimating the bill before feels a bit hard. (Though if you're reading this more as a guide, then it doesn't probably matter that much anyway. Cloud happens to cost some money and usually it's okay.)
