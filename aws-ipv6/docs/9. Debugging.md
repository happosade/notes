Nothing ever works on the first try.

## Reachability analyzer

Reachability analyzer is AWS way of showing what kind of path your traffic might take (if there's multiple options, it just lets you know those, but it doesn't really explain them). It currently lacks some features for v6, but hopefully they're coming :fingers_crossed:

I've found it really useful whenever there's bit more hops that you'll need to take care about. Using it isn't the best of experiences unless you have at least some sort of understanding how the bits should flow.
