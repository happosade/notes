# Transit gateway

## What is it?

I see Transit gateways as my core routers in the cloud. Difference being that they are next to useless when it comes to debugging. But they do find the routes between VPCs and other connected resources, like IPSec/DX _(Direct connect, not developer experience)_/IPSEC over DX to your on premises or other clouds.
