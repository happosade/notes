# Application VPC

These are the VPCs that you'll be creating plenty of (or otherwise this whole experiment have been somewhat waste of time and money, as some of the resources are billed by hour) and here your actual applications lives in. It really doesn't matter if you split these subnets per team or application or billing unit.
