# IPv6

It's like having a service mesh, but without the bloat. Each pod (we'll talk more about k8s later on) have their own unique address and... things just talk to each other. Reachability is a breeze, debugging is as easy as it gets and logs get useful addresses that you can check against later on. The solution is also really scalable (not to say that service meshes couldn't scale. Maybe they can, but that's unlikely.)

Some applications may die, yes, but that's the risk I'm willing to take. You have had 27 years to implement this, do better.
