# Notes

Once upon a time there was a world where I used to write more or less all of my thought processes on a notebook and the scrap them whenever I felt like they're somewhat ready to put into use. Every now and then I felt like I'd like to see how I ended up in some solution, so it might sense to make the notes more permanent.

I also hope that they'd be useful for others as well, so I decided to write them publicly. In order to keep track what have happened and how I ended up there and `git` might be the solution for it. Think this as lazy man blog, where the timeline doesn't really matter, so there isn't a need for chronological ordering of anything. Or as the docs-page for some service that actually isn't a service, but a collection of services (architecture or design?).

All of this comes with absolutely no warranty nor support. I hope that you might find some value from here, but that isn't the purpose of this.
If you do have questions on something, you can open an issue or if you think that I'm wrong, open a pull request.

Cheers!
